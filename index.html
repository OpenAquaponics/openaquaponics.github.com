        <h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>For those who are not familiar with setting up hardware and software systems, don't worry.  I'll try my best to keep everything as stright forward and simple as possible.</p>

<p>The following are greate reference instructions in case I missed a step or if something doesnâ€™t work as listed:
<a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads">http://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads</a>
<a href="http://elinux.org/RPi_Easy_SD_Card_Setup">http://elinux.org/RPi_Easy_SD_Card_Setup</a>
<a href="http://www.penguintutor.com/linux/raspberrypi-webserver">http://www.penguintutor.com/linux/raspberrypi-webserver</a></p>

<p>This how-to is going to show you how to setup your Raspberry Pi to host both the OAServer and OANode applications.  This first iteration is going to assume you are running both applications on the same device.  There is nothing stopping you from hosting OAServer on another Linux machine, but for the purposes of this how-to, I will assume you want to run everything on one device.  Eventually there will be a "cloud" instance of OAServer, and you won't need to worry about hosting that software unless you would like to run a local system.  So onward!!</p>

<h3>What you need</h3>

<p>To get started you will need:</p>

<ul>
<li>Computer with SD card reader</li>
<li>Raspberry Pi</li>
<li>SD card (4GB or more)</li>
<li>Ethernet cable (for the initial setup)</li>
<li>Monitor (requires HDMI)</li>
<li>Keyboard</li>
</ul><h3>Download and Install Raspbian</h3>

<p>So we begin the tutorial by downloading and installing the Raspberry Pi image.  The following website has great step-by-step instructions on how to do this.
<a href="http://elinux.org/RPi_Easy_SD_Card_Setup#Copying_the_image_to_an_SD_card_on_Windows">http://elinux.org/RPi_Easy_SD_Card_Setup#Copying_the_image_to_an_SD_card_on_Windows</a></p>

<p>Unplug the SD card from your machine and place it in the Raspberry Pi.  Go ahead and plug in a monitor, keyboard, and power supply.</p>

<p>On first boot execute the following:</p>

<p>sudo raspi-config</p>

<p>, enable ssh</p>

<p>run sudo raspi-config</p>

<p>execute update
optional execute enable boot_behaviour
optional execute expand_rootfs  (depending on SD card size, this can take a long time)</p>

<p>Finish and reboot</p>

<p>While waiting for "Online re-size"</p>

<p>use your router to get IP address of device
putty ip of your device</p>

<p>Optional If you really want to latest run: sudo apt-get upgrade</p>

<h3>Install Developer Packages</h3>

<p>Install a command line text editor of your choice.  There are a multitude of options, choose whichever you prefer.  If you are not sure, <strong>nano</strong> is an easy one to use.</p>

<pre><code>sudo apt-get install vim
sudo apt-get install nano
sudo apt-get install emacs
</code></pre>

<p>Go ahead and make sure these applications are installed.  NTP syncs the system clock and CURL allows you send HTTP messages from the command line.</p>

<pre><code>sudo apt-get install curl ntp
</code></pre>

<p>Now of course you are going to need the GIT client, so go ahead and install it.</p>

<pre><code>sudo apt-get install git
</code></pre>

<h3>Install Optional Packages</h3>

<p>The following packages are optional and are handy to have installed on the system.  </p>

<pre><code>sudo apt-get install locate
sudo apt-get install ack
</code></pre>

<h6># Move these to OAServer</h6>

<h3>Install LAMP Packages</h3>

<p>This will setup the RPi to have a webserver and database running.  OAServer requires this in order to run
Install the Apache server</p>

<pre><code>sudo apt-get install mysql-server
sudo apt-get install apache2
sudo apt-get install php5 php5-mysql php5-curl
sudo apt-get install phpmyadmin
  &lt; Follow the on screen instructions for passwords, you will need MYSQL_PASSWD &gt;
</code></pre>

<p>
NOTE: You may run into problems during the installation of mysql if you SD card is too small.  I'd recommend at least a 8GB SD card.  <a href="http://databaseblog.myname.nl/2013/01/how-to-install-mysql-succesfully-on.html">http://databaseblog.myname.nl/2013/01/how-to-install-mysql-succesfully-on.html</a>
NOTE: Go get a drink.  This can take a while.  </p>
