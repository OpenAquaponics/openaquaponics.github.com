{"name":"OpenAquaponics Software Portal","tagline":"For all of your aquaponics software needs","body":"### Introduction\r\nFor those who are not familiar with setting up hardware and software systems, don't worry.  I'll try my best to keep everything as stright forward and simple as possible.\r\n\r\nThe following are greate reference instructions in case I missed a step or if something doesnâ€™t work as listed:\r\nhttp://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads\r\nhttp://elinux.org/RPi_Easy_SD_Card_Setup\r\nhttp://www.penguintutor.com/linux/raspberrypi-webserver\r\n\r\nThis how-to is going to show you how to setup your Raspberry Pi to host both the OAServer and OANode applications.  This first iteration is going to assume you are running both applications on the same device.  There is nothing stopping you from hosting OAServer on another Linux machine, but for the purposes of this how-to, I will assume you want to run everything on one device.  Eventually there will be a \"cloud\" instance of OAServer, and you won't need to worry about hosting that software unless you would like to run a local system.  So onward!!\r\n\r\n### What you need\r\nTo get started you will need:\r\n  - Computer with SD card reader\r\n  - Raspberry Pi\r\n  - SD card (4GB or more)\r\n  - Ethernet cable (for the initial setup)\r\n  - Monitor (requires HDMI)\r\n  - Keyboard\r\n\r\n### Download and Install Raspbian\r\nSo we begin the tutorial by downloading and installing the Raspberry Pi image.  The following website has great step-by-step instructions on how to do this.\r\nhttp://elinux.org/RPi_Easy_SD_Card_Setup#Copying_the_image_to_an_SD_card_on_Windows\r\n\r\nUnplug the SD card from your machine and place it in the Raspberry Pi.  Go ahead and plug in a monitor, keyboard, and power supply.\r\n\r\nOn first boot execute the following:\r\n\r\nsudo raspi-config\r\n\r\n, enable ssh\r\n\r\nrun sudo raspi-config\r\n\r\nexecute update\r\noptional execute enable boot_behaviour\r\noptional execute expand_rootfs  (depending on SD card size, this can take a long time)\r\n\r\nFinish and reboot\r\n\r\nWhile waiting for \"Online re-size\"\r\n\r\nuse your router to get IP address of device\r\nputty ip of your device\r\n\r\nOptional If you really want to latest run: sudo apt-get upgrade\r\n\r\n\r\n### Install Developer Packages\r\nInstall a command line text editor of your choice.  There are a multitude of options, choose whichever you prefer.  If you are not sure, **nano** is an easy one to use.\r\n```\r\nsudo apt-get install vim\r\nsudo apt-get install nano\r\nsudo apt-get install emacs\r\n```\r\nGo ahead and make sure these applications are installed.  NTP syncs the system clock and CURL allows you send HTTP messages from the command line.\r\n```\r\nsudo apt-get install curl ntp\r\n```\r\nNow of course you are going to need the GIT client, so go ahead and install it.\r\n```\r\nsudo apt-get install git\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Install Optional Packages\r\nThe following packages are optional and are handy to have installed on the system.  \r\n```\r\nsudo apt-get install locate\r\nsudo apt-get install ack\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n####### Move these to OAServer\r\n\r\n### Install LAMP Packages\r\nThis will setup the RPi to have a webserver and database running.  OAServer requires this in order to run\r\nInstall the Apache server\r\n```\r\nsudo apt-get install mysql-server\r\nsudo apt-get install apache2\r\nsudo apt-get install php5 php5-mysql php5-curl\r\nsudo apt-get install phpmyadmin\r\n  < Follow the on screen instructions for passwords, you will need MYSQL_PASSWD >\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n<You will be prompted for a password for the root user.  Put in a password and remember it.  From this point on I'll use MYSQL_PASSWD from this point to refer to this password .>\r\nNOTE: You may run into problems during the installation of mysql if you SD card is too small.  I'd recommend at least a 8GB SD card.  http://databaseblog.myname.nl/2013/01/how-to-install-mysql-succesfully-on.html\r\nNOTE: Go get a drink.  This can take a while.  <Or open another putty session ? >\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
